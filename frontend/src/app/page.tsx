            <p className="mb-8 font-light text-gray-500 sm:text-xl">
              This app is for users who have few or a lot of digital services
              subscriptions and have some trouble management of it.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-8 font-light text-gray-500 sm:text-xl">
              For peoples who forgoting that fist month of subscription is free
              and then you must pay money. Or for people that forgot that prices
              in the future will change. If you want to test some service just
              for one month, you didn't like it but you forgot to unsubscribe
              from it and it will take your money until you didn't notice that
              at your bank mobile app. But with that also a big problem exists.
              When you see your monthly payments you do not always see what
              exactly service takes your money. Or you just want to see the
              amount price of all your services in one place.
            </p>

              So that's all about "Sub-Managik", an app that was created by
              people who understand your problems and want to solve them for
              themselves and other people.
